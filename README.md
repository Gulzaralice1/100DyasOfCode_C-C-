## 🚀 Challenge Overview

The goal is simple: Code every day for 100 days, focusing on C and C++ programming. This will help me build a strong foundation in:
- **Syntax and language features**
- **Memory management and pointers**
- **Data structures and algorithms**
- **File handling and system-level programming**
- **Object-oriented programming (C++)**
- **Problem-solving and optimization techniques**
